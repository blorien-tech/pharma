```
Customer: "I need Napa, mark it as due"
Shopkeeper: Must create full customer profile first...
```

```
1. Type "Napa" in POS → Found by brand name ✓
2. Check "Mark as Due (বাকি)" ✓
3. Enter "Rahman" → Done! ✓
   (phone optional, no profile needed)
4. Sale complete, due recorded ✓
```

### Key Improvements

- **Quick Customer Lookup**: Type phone number → instant match
